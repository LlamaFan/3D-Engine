# Simple 3D Java Engine

A 3D engine written in java that renders different shapes and objects

# About the program

- I didn't create a compiled version yet, so you would either need to start the program in an IDE or compile it yourself
- The program itself is pretty simple:
  - When you start the main method a window will pop up with a default object that spins around its axis
  - The code is mostly commented so it should be easy to understand
  - Changes can be made by adding different objects from a specific .txt file (The vectors and triangles are relive to the origin and also scaled up)
    - These objects can then be applied by creating a own class for the object, which extends the Mesh-class
    - After the object has been created you need to add it to the mesh in the Run-class
    - More changes can be made by going through the project by yourself and understanding how it works
- The project it still not finished though, as I need to update the camera a bit and also make it easier to acutall place objects in the world
